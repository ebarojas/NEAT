# New Experiments in Art Technology

We are a collective that finds connections between art and technology. With every piece of software that we write or curate we strive to explore the depth and breadth of human emotions while pushing the boundaries of what is possible with today's technology. It is not just about implementing technology in contemporary art but about asking the biggest and most challenging questions.

NEAT offers creative solutions to artistic production challenges, providing consulting services at the intersection of art and diverse digital media. We offer guidance on buying, selling, production, and conservation of digital art for both institutions and public and private collections.
